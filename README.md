# Crosswords
Little code to generate crosswords

## Compilation
Just go to src, and make in there:
`make`

An executable called main should appear

## Usage
Update the vecotr in main.cpp to generate crosswords for other words.

## Limitations
This is unexplored territory. The code has been tested for 4 words, but it should work for more!
